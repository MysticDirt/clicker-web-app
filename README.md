## Demo App

This is a clicker app I made to learn React and Next.JS for Aggieworks. 

I cannot pay for a nonstatic hosting service with a backend, so I will put installation instructions.

Simply clone the repository and run `pnpm dev` and it should start running locally.

Of course, make sure `pnpm` is installed (install using npm).
